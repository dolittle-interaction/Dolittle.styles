# Settings

**Used with preprocessors and contain font, colors definitions, etc.**

Settings is basically a set of variables that the underlying layers are using. All the variables have got default set values. It's marked `!default` so that the preprocessor build, will say this: _"If no other value is set to this variable by now, this is what it'll get."_

{{% children  %}}
