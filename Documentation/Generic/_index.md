# Generic

The generic style layer is mostly just a file with styles from Normalize.css. Slightly modified. There are three variables that you can override.

## Variables

```scss
$body-background-color: $color-gray-lightest !default;
$body-text-color:       $color-gray-darkest !default;
$background-body:       $body-background-color no-repeat !default;
```
