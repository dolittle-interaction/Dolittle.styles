        <p>In objects you can find some cool stuff like grid and other handy objects.</p>

        <h2>Grid</h2>
        <p>The grid is a bit unlike the ones you are used to in other big frameworks. Since this is aiming for creating as less
            style as possible and only ouput the styles you actually uses.</p>
        <p>So instead of outputing 100ish lines of predefined column sets and different grid tools that you never use, this
            grid is a set of placeholders. What you'll do is that you write your styles and semantically give your elements
            class names, and in the scss, you extend placeholders that fits your needs. Examåles will follow.
